This package has moved to https://github.com/OFAI/BayesianNonparametrics.jl

# BNP.jl
BNP.jl is a Julia package implementing state of the art **Bayesian nonparametric** models for medium-sized unsupervised problems. 
The software package brings Bayesian nonparametrics to non-specialists allowing the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric models. 
Emphasis is put on consistency, performance and ease of use allowing easy access to Bayesian nonparametric models inside Julia.
