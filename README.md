# BNP.jl

BNP is a Julia (julialang.org) package implementing **Bayesian nonparametric** methods.

## Usage
Notes on the usage will follow, for now please take a look at the **playground** folder.

## Contents
The following methods are **currently supported** by BNP:
- Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (Gibbs with CRP)
- nonparametric Variable Clustering Model (Gibbs with CRP)
- Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (Gibbs with Beta Variables)

The following methods are **under development or planned**:
- CrossCat Model (Gibbs)
- Distance Depending Chinese Restaurant Process (Gibbs)
- Distance Depending Chinese Restaurant Franchise (Gibbs)
- ( Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Model (Gibbs with CRF) )
- Indian Buffet Process (Gibbs)
- Tree-Structured Stick Breaking (Gibbs)

## Examples
Examples can be found in the playground folder.
